# Sri Lanka Stack

Sri Lanka Stack is a customized version of the digital infrastructure framework inspired by India Stack. It is designed specifically for Sri Lanka, aiming to provide a comprehensive and secure platform for digital services, government interactions, financial transactions, and identity verification in the country.

Similar to India Stack, Sri Lanka Stack consists of several key components:

1. **National Identification System (NIS):** NIS serves as the core identity verification system, providing a unique identification number to residents of Sri Lanka. It acts as a foundation for various digital services and enables secure authentication and verification processes.

2. **Unified Payment Interface (UPI):** UPI, tailored to the Sri Lankan context, is a real-time payment system that facilitates instant money transfers between bank accounts. It promotes digital transactions and simplifies the payment ecosystem, enhancing financial inclusion and convenience for individuals and businesses.

3. **e-Government Services (eGov):** eGov is a platform that enables Sri Lankan citizens to access government services online. It offers a wide range of services, such as applying for passports, driving licenses, tax filings, and birth certificates. By digitizing government services, eGov streamlines processes, reduces paperwork, and improves accessibility for citizens.

4. **Digital Health Records (DHR):** DHR is a secure and centralized digital repository for individuals' health records in Sri Lanka. It allows healthcare providers to access and share patients' medical information seamlessly, ensuring efficient healthcare delivery and continuity of care.

5. **Digital Education Platform (DEP):** DEP is a digital platform designed to enhance the education system in Sri Lanka. It provides online learning resources, digital textbooks, and interactive tools for students and teachers. DEP aims to bridge the education gap, promote remote learning, and foster digital literacy across the country.

6. **Digital Signature Framework (DSF):** DSF enables individuals and businesses to sign and authenticate documents digitally. It ensures the integrity and authenticity of transactions, reduces reliance on physical paperwork, and accelerates digital processes.

The Sri Lanka Stack aims to leverage these components to transform Sri Lanka into a digitally empowered society. It facilitates secure and interoperable digital transactions, promotes e-governance, drives financial inclusion, improves healthcare services, enhances education accessibility, and fosters overall economic growth and development in the country.
