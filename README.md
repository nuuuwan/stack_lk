3. **eDocumentsLK:** eDocumentsLK is a digital document storage platform that allows individuals to securely store and access their important government-issued documents digitally. It eliminates the need for physical copies and provides a convenient way to retrieve documents whenever necessary.

4. **eKYC (Electronic Know Your Customer):** eKYC enables organizations to remotely verify the identity and address of customers using NIC-based authentication. It simplifies customer onboarding processes by eliminating the requirement for physical documents.

5. **eSignLK:** eSignLK is a digital signing framework that enables individuals to electronically sign documents using NIC authentication. It ensures the legality and security of digital signatures, making it easier to sign contracts and agreements digitally.

These components, supported by relevant technologies and platforms, form the core of StackLK.
